2022: <https://github.com/rstudio-conf-2022/pkg-dev-masterclass>

Hadley + Jenny + Gabor + Davis.

Main changes:

-   only 1 day
-   reduce free time
-   reduce CRAN/GitHub

Proposed agenda:

1.  Test tooling & design:
    -   running tests (you should be using `R CMD check`!)
    -   testthat 3e
    -   parallel (i.e. it exists and you should use it) + `TESTTHAT_CPUS` env var
    -   eliminate top level code: helpers, setup.R, etc
    -   localise changes: fixtures/set_state_inspector()
    -   mocking
2.  cli errors + snapshot testing
3.  [https://design.tidyverse.org](https://design.tidyverse.org?) through the lens of testing
    1.  Code that is hard to test is often hard to use/understand/document
    2.  Code coverage
    3.  Extracting out code just for testing
4.  Your package + office hours:
    1.  `R CMD check`

    2.  `usethis::use_testthat(3)`

    3.  Align the names of `R/` and `test/` files

    4.  Refactor your tests (top-level and duplicated code)

    5.  Build and preview a pkgdown site locally
