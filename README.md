## Overview

In this one-day masterclass, you'll have the opportunity to dig deep into package development.
We'll cover a selection of cutting-edge topics (e.g. advanced testing tools, writing actionable error messages) that have significantly impacted the way the tidyverse team has developed packages in the last couple of years.
There will be plenty of time to apply what you learn to your own package(s), in an environment where you can get help and talk things through with members of the tidyverse team.

This workshop is for you if you:

-   Have already developed one or more packages, and are prepared to work on them during with workshop.
-   Are familiar with the basic devtools/RStudio workflow (e.g. `load_all()`, roxygen2, testthat, and usethis).
-   Are familiar with Git.

## Prework

For this workshop, it's really important that you have an existing package because to conclude the day, we'll have 90 minutes for you to apply what you've learned to your own package --- if you don't, we'd recommend you switch to the "Fundamentals of Package Development".
You'll also need to make sure you have your laptop, with your package, and a recent install of devtools and its dependencies (with pak::pak("devtools") or similar).
We'll have more details at <https://github.com/posit-conf-2023/pkg-dev-masterclass> closer to the date.
